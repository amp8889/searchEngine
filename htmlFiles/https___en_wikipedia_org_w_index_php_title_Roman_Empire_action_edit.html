The '''Roman Empire'''{{Efn|name=fnother|Other ways of referring to the "Roman Empire" among the Romans included ''{{lang|la|Res publica Romana}}'', ''{{lang|la|Imperium Romanorum}}'', {{lang|grc|Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων}} ({{grc-tr|Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων}} – ["Dominion ('kingdom' but interpreted as 'empire') of the Romans"]) and ''Romania''. ''{{lang|la|Res publica}}'' means Roman "commonwealth"&lt;!--?: Usually,--> and can refer to both the Republican and the Imperial eras. ''{{lang|la|Imperium Romanum}}'' (or "{{lang|la|Romanorum}}") refers to the territorial extent of Roman authority. ''{{lang|la| Populus Romanus}}'' ("the Roman people") was/is often [[Metonym|used to indicate the Roman state]] in matters involving other nations. The term ''Romania'', initially a colloquial term for the empire's territory as well as a [[Collective noun|collective name]] for its inhabitants, appears in Greek and Latin sources from the 4th century onward and was eventually carried over to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wolff |first=Robert Lee |author-link=Robert Lee Wolff |date=1948 |title=Romania: The Latin Empire of Constantinople |volume=23 |pages=1–34, especially 2–3 |journal=Speculum|issue=1 |doi=10.2307/2853672 |jstor=2853672 |s2cid=162802725 }}&lt;/ref>}} was the post-[[Roman Republic|Republican]] state of [[ancient Rome]]. It is generally understood to mean the period and territory ruled by the [[Roman people|Romans]] following [[Octavian]]'s assumption of sole rule under the [[Principate]] in 27 BC. It included territories in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[Western Asia]] and was ruled by [[Roman emperor|emperors]]. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD conventionally marks the end of [[classical antiquity]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].

Rome had expanded its rule to most of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and beyond. However, it was severely destabilized in [[List of Roman civil wars and revolts|civil wars and political conflicts]] which culminated in the [[Wars of Augustus|victory of Octavian]] over [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] in Egypt. In 27 BC, the [[Roman Senate]] granted [[Octavian]] overarching power (''[[imperium]]'') and the new title of ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'', marking his [[Constitutional reforms of Augustus|accession as the first Roman emperor]] of a [[Principate|monarchy]] with [[Rome]] as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in [[Senatorial province|senatorial]] and [[Imperial province|imperial]] provinces.

The [[History of the Roman Empire|first two centuries of the Empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] ({{Literal translation|Roman Peace}}). Rome reached its [[Borders of the Roman Empire|greatest territorial expanse]] under [[Trajan]] (r.98–117 AD); a period of increasing trouble and decline began under [[Commodus]] (180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a [[Crisis of the Third Century|crisis]] that threatened its existence, as the [[Gallic Empire|Gallic]] and [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrene]] Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [[Barracks emperor|short-lived emperors]] led the Empire. It was reunified under [[Aurelian]] ({{Reign|270|275}}). [[Diocletian]] set up two different imperial courts in the [[Greek East and Latin West]] in 286; [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christians rose to power]] in the 4th century after the [[Edict of Milan]]. The imperial seat moved from Rome to [[Names of Istanbul|Byzantium]] in 330, renamed [[Constantinople]] after [[Constantine the Great]]. The [[Migration Period]], involving [[Germanic–Roman contacts|large invasions by Germanic peoples]] and by the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]], led to the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. With the [[Battle of Ravenna (476)|fall of Ravenna]] to the [[Heruli|Germanic Herulians]] and the [[deposition of Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD by [[Odoacer]], the [[Western Roman Empire]] finally collapsed. The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] survived for another millennium with [[Constantinople]] as its sole capital, until [[Fall of Constantinople|the city's fall]] in 1453.{{Efn|The Ottomans sometimes called their state the "Empire of [[Rûm]]" ({{lang-ota|دولت علنإه روم|lit=Exalted State of Rome}}). In this sense, it could be argued that a "Roman" Empire survived until the early 20th century.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=Military Transition in Early Modern Asia, 1400–1750: Cavalry, Guns, Government and Ships |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-78093-800-4 |series=Bloomsbury Studies in Military History |page=37 |quote=After the capture of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire became the capital of the Ottoman Empire.

Due to the Empire's extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had [[legacy of the Roman Empire|a lasting influence]] on the development of [[history of Latin|language]], [[religion in ancient Rome|religion]], [[Roman art|art]], [[Ancient Roman architecture|architecture]], [[Latin literature|literature]], [[Ancient Roman philosophy|philosophy]], [[Roman law|law]], and [[Roman magistrate|forms of government]] across its territories. [[Latin]] evolved into the [[Romance languages]] while [[History of Greek|Medieval Greek]] became the language of the East. The [[Edict of Thessalonica|Empire's adoption]] of [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|Christianity]] resulted in the formation of medieval [[Christendom]]. Roman and [[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]] had a profound impact on the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Rome's architectural tradition served as the basis for [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]], influencing [[Islamic architecture]]. The rediscovery of [[Science in classical antiquity|classical science]] and [[Ancient Roman technology|technology]] (which formed the basis for [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic science]]) in medieval Europe contributed to the [[Science in the Renaissance|Scientific Renaissance]] and [[Scientific Revolution]]. Many modern legal systems, such as the [[Napoleonic Code]], descend from Roman law. Rome's republican institutions have [[Classical tradition|influenced]] the [[Maritime republics|Italian city-state republics]] of the medieval period, the early [[United States]], and modern democratic [[Republic|republics]].

Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the [[Roman Republic]] in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an "empire" (a great power) long before it had an emperor.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Kelly|2007|pp=4ff}}; {{Harvp|Nicolet|1991|pp=1, 15}}; {{Cite book |last=Brennan |first=T.

It was governed by annually elected [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] ([[Roman consul]]s above all) in conjunction with the Senate.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=179}} The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors.{{Sfnp|Nicolet|1991|pp=1, 15}}&lt;ref name=Hekster/>&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Lintott |first=Andrew |title=The Constitution of the Roman Republic |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=114 |author-link=Andrew Lintott}}; {{Cite book |last=Eder |first=W. |chapter=The Augustan Principate as Binding Link |date=1993 |title=Between Republic and Empire |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08447-0 |page=98}}&lt;/ref> The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of ''[[imperium]]'', meaning "command" (though typically in a military sense).&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=John |chapter=Fines provincial |date=2011 |title=Frontiers in the Roman World |publisher=Brill |page=10}}&lt;/ref> Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title ''[[imperator]]'' (commander); this is the origin of the word ''emperor'', since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.{{Sfnp|Richardson|2011|pp=1–2}}

Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]] from the late second century BC (see [[Crisis of the Roman Republic]]) while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC [[Julius Caesar]] was briefly ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' before being [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]]. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC by [[Mark Antony]] and Caesar's adopted son [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. In 27 BC the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] made Octavian ''[[princeps]]'' ("first citizen") with [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'', thus beginning the [[Principate]] (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the title ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' ("the venerated"). Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Syme |first=Ronald |title=The Roman Revolution |date=1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=3–4 |author-link=Ronald Syme}}&lt;/ref> Since his rule began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch ''[[de facto]]'' if not ''[[de jure]]''. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order operated as before when [[Tiberius]] was accepted as the new emperor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' ("Roman Peace"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down "mercilessly and swiftly".&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Boatwright |first=Mary T. |title=Hadrian and the Cities of the Roman Empire |date=2000 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=4 |author-link=Mary T.

The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] lasted for four more emperors—[[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], [[Claudius]], and [[Nero]]—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn [[Year of the Four Emperors]], from which [[Vespasian]] emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief [[Flavian dynasty]], followed by the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]] which produced the "[[Five Good Emperors]]": [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

In 212, during the reign of [[Caracalla]], [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire.

According to the [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]], the essential distinction in the Roman "[[legal personality|law of persons]]" was that all humans were either free (''liberi'') or slaves (''servi'').&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Frier|McGinn|2004|p=14}}; [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], ''[[Institutes of Gaius|Institutiones]]'' 1.9 ''Digest'' 1.5.3.&lt;/ref> The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the ''[[ius Latinum]]'', "Latin right"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were ''[[peregrinus (Roman)|peregrini]]'', non-Romans.{{Sfnp|Frier|McGinn|2004|pp=31–32}} In 212, the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=177}}

Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ''ex duobus civibus Romanis natos'' ("children born of two Roman citizens").{{Efn|The ''civis'' ("citizen") stands in explicit contrast to a ''[[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrina]]'', a foreign or non-Roman woman&lt;ref>{{Citation |last=Sherwin-White |first=A.N. |title=Roman Citizenship |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author-link=A.

A soldier, for instance, was banned from marrying while in service, but if he formed a long-term union with a local woman while stationed in the provinces, he could marry her legally after he was discharged, and any children they had would be considered the offspring of citizens—in effect granting the woman retroactive citizenship. The ban was in place from the time of Augustus until it was rescinded by [[Septimius Severus]] in 197 AD.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Phang |first=Sara Elise |title=The Marriage of Roman Soldiers (13 B.C.–A.D. 235): Law and Family in the Imperial Army |date=2001 |publisher=Brill |page=2}}; {{Cite book |last=Southern |first=Pat |title=The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=144 |author-link=Pat Southern}}&lt;/ref>}} A Roman woman kept her own [[Roman naming conventions|family name]] (''nomen'') for life.

The archaic [[manus marriage|''manus'' marriage]] in which the woman was subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage.

====Slaves and the law====
{{Main|Slavery in ancient Rome}}
At the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in [[Roman Italy]] were slaves,{{Sfnp|Bradley|1994|p=12}} making Rome one of five historical "slave societies" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy.{{Efn|The others are [[Slavery in ancient Greece|ancient Athens]], and in the modern era [[Slavery in Brazil|Brazil]], the [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|Caribbean]], and the [[Slavery in the United States|United States]]}}{{Sfnp|Bradley|1994|p=12}} Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.{{Sfnp|Bradley|1994|p=15}} In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour. [[Agriculture in ancient Rome|Agriculture]] and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in [[Roman Egypt]] but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Harris|1999|pp=62–75}}; {{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Timothy |date=2010 |title=Believing the ancients: Quantitative and qualitative dimensions of slavery and the slave trade in later prehistoric Eurasia |journal=World Archaeology |volume=33 |issue=1 |arxiv=0706.4406 |doi=10.1080/00438240120047618 |pages=27–43 |s2cid=162250553}}&lt;/ref> Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Harper |first=Kyle |title=Slavery in the Late Roman World, AD 275–425 |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref>

[[File:Sarcofago avvocato Valerius Petrnianus-optimized.jpg|thumb|Slave holding writing tablets for his master ([[relief]] from a 4th-century sarcophagus)]]
Laws pertaining to slavery were "extremely intricate".{{Sfnp|Frier|McGinn|2004|p=7}} Slaves were considered property and had no [[Person (law)|legal personhood]]. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual exploitation]], torture, and [[summary execution]]. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped; a slave's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the [[Lex Aquilia|Aquilian Law]].&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=McGinn |first=Thomas A.J. |title=Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-516132-7 |page=314}}; {{Cite book |last=Gardner |first=Jane F. |title=Women in Roman Law and Society |date=1991 |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=119}}&lt;/ref> Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called ''[[Marriage in ancient Rome|conubium]]'', but their unions were sometimes recognized.{{Sfnp|Frier|McGinn|2004|pp=31–33}} Technically, a slave could not own property,{{Sfnp|Frier|McGinn|2004|p=21}} but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund (''peculium'') that he could use, depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gamauf |first=Richard |date=2009 |title=Slaves doing business: The role of Roman law in the economy of a Roman household |journal=European Review of History |volume=16 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/13507480902916837 |pages=331–346 |s2cid=145609520}}&lt;/ref> Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave acting as the master of others.{{Sfnp|Bradley|1994|pp=2–3}} Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough ''peculium'' to justify their freedom, or be [[Manumission|manumitted]] for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (''[[Lex Fufia Caninia]]'') limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.{{Sfnp|Bradley|1994|p=10}}

Following the [[Servile Wars]] of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Fuhrmann |first=C. J. |title=Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-973784-0 |pages=21–41}}&lt;/ref> Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes in ancient Rome]] were often slaves.{{Sfnp|McGinn|1998|pp=288ff}} The burgeoning trade in [[eunuch]]s in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Castration and circumcision|castration]] of a slave against his will "for lust or gain".&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Abusch |first=Ra'anan |chapter=Circumcision and Castration under Roman Law in the Early Empire |date=2003 |title=The Covenant of Circumcision: New Perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite |publisher=Brandeis University Press |pages=77–78}}; {{Cite book |last=Schäfer |first=Peter |title=The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |page=150 |orig-date=1983}}&lt;/ref>

During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the [[Greece in the Roman era|conquest of Greece]] brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by [[Cilician pirates|pirates]]. [[Child abandonment|Infant abandonment]] and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources.{{Sfnp|Harris|1999}} ''[[Slavery in ancient Rome#Vernae|Vernae]]'', by contrast, were "homegrown" slaves born to female slaves within the household, estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his ''vernae'' faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Rawson|1987|pp=186–188, 190}}; {{Harvp|Bradley|1994|pp=34, 48–50}}&lt;/ref>

====Freedmen====
[[File:DM Tiberius Claudius Chryseros.jpg|thumb|[[Urn#Cremation urns|Cinerary urn]] for the freedman Tiberius Claudius Chryseros and two women, probably his wife and daughter]]
Rome differed from [[Greek city-states]] in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom (''libertas''), including the right to vote.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Millar |first=Fergus |title=The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic |date=2002 |publisher=University of Michigan |isbn=0-472-08878-5 |pages=23, 209 |author-link=Fergus Millar |orig-date=1998}}&lt;/ref> His former master became his patron (''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronus]]''): the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Mouritsen |first=Henrik |title=The Freedman in the Roman World |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=36}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref name="berger">{{Cite book |last=Berger |first=Adolf |chapter=libertus |date=1991 |title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law |publisher=American Philological Society |page=564 |orig-date=1953}}&lt;/ref> A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a [[Augustales|priestly role]]. He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that [[Hadrian]] limited their participation by law.&lt;ref name=berger/> The rise of successful freedmen—through political influence or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by [[:Commons:Category:Liberti and libertae in Ancient Roman inscriptions|inscriptions throughout the Empire]], and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at [[Pompeii]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

===Census rank===
{{See also|Senate of the Roman Empire|Equestrian order|Decurion (administrative)}}
The Latin word ''ordo'' (plural ''ordines'') is translated variously and inexactly into English as "class, order, rank". One purpose of the [[Roman census]] was to determine the ''ordo'' to which an individual belonged. The two highest ''ordines'' in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}} Outside Rome, the [[decurion (administrative)|decurions]], also known as ''[[curiales]]'', were the top governing ''ordo'' of an individual city.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

[[File:0 Sarcophage d'Acilia - Pal. Massimo alle Terme.JPG|thumb|left|Fragment of a sarcophagus depicting [[Gordian III]] and senators (3rd century)]]
"Senator" was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|executive magistrate]]. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million ''[[sestertii]]''.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Boardman|2000|pp=217–218}}; {{Cite book |last=Syme |first=Ronald |title=Provincial at Rome: and Rome and the Balkans 80 BC – AD 14 |date=1999 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |isbn=0-85989-632-3 |pages=12–13 |author-link=Ronald Syme}}&lt;/ref> Not all men who qualified for the ''ordo senatorius'' chose to take a Senate seat, which required [[Domicile (law)|legal domicile]] at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Boardman|2000|pp=215, 221–222}}; {{Harvp|Millar|2012|p=88|loc=The standard complement of 600 was flexible; twenty [[quaestor]]s, for instance, held office each year and were thus admitted to the Senate regardless of whether there were "open" seats}}&lt;/ref> A senator's son belonged to the ''ordo senatorius'', but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=88}}

In the time of Nero, senators were still primarily from [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]], with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian.{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|pp=218–219}} The first senator from the easternmost province, [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], was admitted under Marcus Aurelius.{{Efn|That senator was Tiberius Claudius Gordianus{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|p=219}}}} By the [[Severan dynasty]] (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=MacMullen |first=Ramsay |date=1966 |title=Provincial Languages in the Roman Empire |journal=The American Journal of Philology |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.2307/292973 |pages=1–17|jstor=292973 }}&lt;/ref> During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (''patria'').{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=88}}

Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', the political career track, but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome's early days, ''equites'' or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors, but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire.{{Efn|The relation of the equestrian order to the "public horse" and Roman cavalry parades and demonstrations (such as the ''[[Lusus Troiae]]'') is complex, but those who participated in the latter seem, for instance, to have been the ''equites'' who were accorded the high-status (and quite limited) seating at the theatre by the ''[[Lex Roscia theatralis]]''. Senators could not possess the "public horse".{{Sfnp|Wiseman|1970|pp=78–79}}}} A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian.{{Sfnp|Wiseman|1970|pp=71–72, 76}} The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at [[Cádiz]] and [[Padua]] alone.{{Efn|Ancient Gades, in Roman Spain (now [[Cádiz]]), and Patavium, in the Celtic north of Italy (now [[Padua]]), were atypically wealthy cities, and having 500 equestrians in one city was unusual.&lt;ref>[[Strabo]] 3.169, 5.213&lt;/ref>}}{{Sfnp|Wiseman|1970|pp=75–76, 78}} Equestrians rose through a military career track (''[[tres militiae]]'') to become highly placed [[prefect]]s and [[procurator (Roman)|procurators]] within the Imperial administration.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Fear |first=Andrew |chapter=War and Society |date=2007 |title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-78274-6 |volume=2 |pages=214–215}}; {{Harvp|Bennett|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref>

The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later [[European nobility]], a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=188}}; {{Harvp|Millar|2012|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref> Admission to the higher ''ordines'' brought distinction and privileges, but also responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''). Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures.{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=96}} Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Liebeschuetz |first=Wolfgang |chapter=The End of the Ancient City |date=2001 |title=The City in Late Antiquity |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref>

In the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("worth, esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as ''[[vir illustris]]'' ("illustrious man").{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=90|loc=calls them "status-appellations"}} The appellation ''clarissimus'' (Greek ''lamprotatos'') was used to designate the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' of certain senators and their immediate family, including women.{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=91}} "Grades" of equestrian status proliferated.{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=90}}

As the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (''honestiores'') and humbler folk (''humiliores'').

The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government.{{Sfnp|Bohec|2000|p=8}} The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites.{{Sfnp|Bohec|2000|pp=14–15}} The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone. [[Local government (ancient Roman)|Cooperation with local elites]] was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue.

Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=184}} Roman government was thus [[limited government|limited]], but efficient in its use of available resources.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=181}}

The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate, he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions.

Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception (''salutatio''), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at [[#Spectacles|games]].{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|p=212}} By the 4th century, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.{{Sfnp|Millar|2012|p=76}} Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it retained its symbolic political centrality.{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|p=215}} The Senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor employed senators as legates (''[[legatus|legati]]''): generals, diplomats, and administrators.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Boardman|2000|p=721}}; {{Harvp|Winterling|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref>

The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military. The [[Legionary|legionaries]] were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual [[Sacramentum (oath)|oath of loyalty]] to the emperor.{{Sfnp|Goldsworthy|2003|p=80}} Most emperors chose a successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the ''[[donativum]]'', a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.{{Sfnp|Winterling|2009|p=16}}

{{Main|Imperial Roman army|Late Roman army|Structural history of the Roman military}}

After the [[Punic Wars]], the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of [[conscripts|conscript citizens]] defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by "organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army".&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last1=Tignor |first1=Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/worldstogetherwo03alti |title=Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: The History of the World |last2=Adelman |first2=Jeremy |date=2011 |publisher=W.W.

The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Hekster |first=Olivier J. |chapter=Fighting for Rome: The Emperor as a Military Leader |date=2007 |title=Impact of the Roman Army (200 BC–AD 476) |publisher=Brill |page=96}}&lt;/ref> The three major divisions of the military were:
* the garrison at Rome, comprising the [[Praetorian Guard]], the ''[[cohortes urbanae]]'' and the ''[[vigiles]]'', who functioned as police and firefighters;
* the provincial army, comprising the [[Roman legions]] and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces (''[[auxilia]]'');
* the [[Roman navy|navy]].

Through his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus regularized the legion. A legion was organized into ten [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], each of which comprised six [[centuria|centuries]], with a century further made up of ten squads (''[[Contubernium (Roman army unit)|contubernia]]''); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which was likely determined by [[military logistics|logistics]], has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Roth |first=J. |date=1994 |title=The Size and Organization of the Roman Imperial Legion |journal=Historia |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=346–362}}&lt;/ref> After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 30.{{Sfnp|Goldsworthy|2003|p=183}} The army had about 300,000 soldiers in the 1st century, and under 400,000 in the 2nd, "significantly smaller" than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories. No more than 2% of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army.{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=196}} Augustus also created the [[Praetorian Guard]]: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Penrose |first=Jane |quote=Section 3: ''Early Empire 27 BC–AD 235'' |date=2005 |title=Rome and Her Enemies: An Empire Created and Destroyed by War |publisher=Bloomsbury US |isbn=978-1-841-76932-5 |page=183 |chapter=9: ''The Romans''}}&lt;/ref>

The ''auxilia'' were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with [[Roman citizenship]], also extended to their sons. According to [[Tacitus]]&lt;ref>[[Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' IV.5&lt;/ref> there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries—thus, around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments.{{Sfnp|Goldsworthy|2003|p=51}} The [[Roman cavalry]] of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Connolly |first=Peter |date=1986 |title=A Reconstruction of a Roman Saddle |journal=Britannia |volume=17 |doi=10.2307/526559 |pages=353–355 |jstor=526559 |s2cid=164155025}}; {{Cite journal |last1=Connolly |first1=Peter |last2=Van Driel-Murray |first2=Carol |date=1991 |title=The Roman Cavalry Saddle |journal=Britannia |volume=22 |doi=10.2307/526629 |pages=33–50 |jstor=526629 |s2cid=161535316}}&lt;/ref>

The [[Roman navy]] not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|frontiers]] along the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean, parts of the [[Atlantic|North Atlantic]] coasts, and the [[Black Sea]]. Nevertheless, the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.{{Sfnp|Goldsworthy|2003|p=114}}

===Provincial government===

An annexed territory became a [[Roman province]] in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=183}} Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|pp=177–179|loc=Most government records that are preserved come from Roman Egypt, where the climate preserved the papyri.}} In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=179}} Among these officials were the [[Roman governor]]s: [[executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|magistrates elected at Rome]] who in the name of the [[SPQR|Roman people]] governed [[senatorial province]]s; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their ''imperium'' on behalf of the emperor in [[imperial province]]s, most notably [[Roman Egypt]].{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=179|loc=The exclusion of Egypt from the senatorial provinces dates to the rise of Octavian before he became Augustus: Egypt had been the stronghold of his last opposition, [[Mark Antony]] and his ally [[Cleopatra]].}} A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=180}} His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (''[[apparitor]]es''), including [[lictor]]s, heralds, messengers, [[Scriba (ancient Rome)|scribes]], and bodyguards; [[legatus|legates]], both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=180}}

Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=179}} Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era, to avoid provincial governors and [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]] exploiting local populations for personal gain.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|pp=179, 187}} Equestrian [[Procurator (Roman)|procurators]], whose authority was originally "extra-judicial and extra-constitutional", managed both state-owned property and the personal property of the emperor (''[[privatus|res privata]]'').{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=180}} Because Roman government officials were few, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Potter|2009|p=180}}; {{Harvp|Fuhrmann|2012|pp=197, 214, 224}}&lt;/ref>

Roman courts held [[original jurisdiction]] over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures.&lt;ref name=Garnsey/> Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the ''mos regionis'' ("regional tradition" or "law of the land") and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability.&lt;ref name=Garnsey/>{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|pp=184–185}} The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ''[[ius gentium]]'', the "law of nations" or [[international law]] regarded as common and customary.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Bozeman |first=Adda B. |title=Politics and Culture in International History from the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age |date=2010 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |edition=2nd |pages=208–220}}&lt;/ref> If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard [[Appellate court|appeals]], and the emperor held final decision-making authority.&lt;ref name=Garnsey/>{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|pp=184–185}}{{Efn|This practice was established in the Republic; see for instance the case of [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus#Contrebian water rights|Contrebian water rights]] heard by G.

Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite.&lt;ref name=Garnsey/> The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing local law codes that had applied to non-citizens.

[[File:Foro_romano_tempio_Saturno_09feb08_01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Saturn]], a religious monument that housed the treasury in ancient Rome]]

Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its [[Roman gross domestic product|gross product]].{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=183}} The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=187}} The tax code was "bewildering" in its complicated system of [[direct taxation|direct]] and [[indirect taxes]], some paid in cash and some [[barter|in kind]]. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as [[fishery|fisheries]]; they might be temporary.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|pp=185–187}} Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=184}}; {{Harvp|Potter|2009|p=185}}&lt;/ref> and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=185}} In-kind taxes were accepted from less-[[monetization|monetized]] areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=188}}

The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=187}} Tax obligations were determined by the census: each head of household provided a headcount of his household, as well as an accounting of his property.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=186}} A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the ''portoria'', customs and tolls on trade, including among provinces.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=187}} Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves,&lt;ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 55.31.4.&lt;/ref> which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices.&lt;ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 13.31.2.&lt;/ref> An owner who manumitted a slave paid a "freedom tax", calculated at 5% of value.{{Efn|This was the ''vicesima libertatis'', "the twentieth for freedom"{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=187}}}} An [[inheritance tax]] of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans' pension fund (''[[aerarium militare]]'').{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=187}}

Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the "super-rich", but in the later period, the [[tax resistance|resistance]] of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=184}}

Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face. This tendency towards [[fiat money]] led to the [[debasement]] of Roman coinage in the later Empire.{{Sfnp|Harris|2010}} The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration.&lt;ref name=Kessler/> The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the [[money supply]] for trading or saving.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Scheidel |first=Walter |chapter=The Monetary Systems of the Han and Roman Empires |date=2009 |title=Rome and China.

Rome had no [[central bank]], and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept [[fractional reserve banking|less in reserves]] than the full total of customers' deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited [[Financial capital|capital]], and often only one principal. [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] assumes that anyone involved in [[Roman commerce]] needs access to [[Credit (finance)|credit]].{{Sfnp|Harris|2010}} A professional [[Deposit account|deposit]] banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Harris|2010}}; {{Cite book |last=Andreau |first=Jean |title=Banking and Business in the Roman World |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=2}}&lt;/ref> The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked [[negotiable instrument|documentary transactions]], the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD;&lt;ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 6.17.3.&lt;/ref> generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers.{{Sfnp|Harris|2010}} The central government itself did not borrow money, and without [[public debt]] had to fund [[Government budget balance|deficits]] from cash reserves.{{Sfnp|Duncan-Jones|1994|pp=3–4}}

Land transport utilized the advanced system of [[Roman roads]], called "''viae''". These roads were primarily built for military purposes,&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Van Tilburg |first=Cornelis |title=Traffic and Congestion in the Roman Empire |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |page=33}}&lt;/ref> but also served commercial ends. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the state mail and transport service established by Augustus.{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=188}} Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve [[Roman mile]]s, and tended to grow into villages or trading posts.{{Sfnp|Stambaugh|1988|p=253}} A ''[[mansio]]'' (plural ''mansiones'') was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the ''cursus publicus''. The distance between ''mansiones'' was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day.{{Sfnp|Stambaugh|1988|p=253}} Carts were usually pulled by mules, travelling about 4&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref>[[Ray Laurence]], "Land Transport in Roman Italy: Costs, Practice and the Economy", in ''Trade, Traders and the Ancient City'' (Routledge, 1998), p. 129.&lt;/ref>

===Trade and commodities===
{{See also|Roman commerce|Indo-Roman trade relations|Sino-Roman relations}}

Roman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as [[Ancient China|China]] and [[Gupta Empire|India]].{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|p=713}} Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the [[Silk Road]]; Indian trade also occurred by sea from [[Roman Egypt|Egyptian]] ports. The main [[commodity]] was grain.{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|p=710}} Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs, ''[[garum]]'' ([[fish sauce]]), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]], [[Roman glass|glassware]], marble, [[papyrus]], spices and ''[[materia medica]]'', ivory, pearls, and gemstones.{{Sfnp|Boardman|2000|pp=717–729}} Though most provinces could produce wine, [[Ancient Rome and wine|regional varietals]] were desirable and wine was a central trade good.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Bowman|Garnsey|Cameron|2005|p=404}}; {{Harvp|Boardman|2000|p=719}}&lt;/ref>

===Labour and occupations===

Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii.{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=196}} Professional associations or trade guilds (''collegia'') are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized.&lt;ref name=verb/>

Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; [[Slavery in ancient Rome#Servus publicus|imperial or public service]]; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal.{{Sfnp|Gagarin|2010|p=323}} In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free,&lt;ref name=Garnsey/> and most workers were illiterate and without special skills.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Temin |first=Peter |date=2004 |title=The Labor Market of the Early Roman Empire |journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume=34 |issue=4 |doi=10.1162/002219504773512525 |pages=513–538 |s2cid=33380115 }}&lt;/ref> The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in Italian industrial farming (''[[latifundia]]''), these may have been mostly slaves, but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important.&lt;ref name=Garnsey/>

Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns, like a [[fashion brand|fashion "label"]].{{Sfnp|Jones|1960|pp=184–185}} Better ready-to-wear was exported by local businessmen (''negotiatores'' or ''mercatores'').{{Sfnp|Jones|1960|p=192}} Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, by ''vestiarii'' (clothing dealers), or peddled by itinerant merchants.{{Sfnp|Jones|1960|p=192}} The [[fulling|fullers]] (''[[fullonica|fullones]]'') and dye workers (''coloratores'') had their own guilds.{{Sfnp|Jones|1960|pp=190–191}} ''Centonarii'' were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into [[patchwork|pieced goods]].{{Efn|The college of ''centonarii'' is an elusive topic in scholarship, since they are also widely attested as urban firefighters.{{Sfnp|Vout|2009|p=212}}&lt;ref name="Liu">{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=Jinyu |title=Collegia Centonariorum: The Guilds of Textile Dealers in the Roman West |date=2009 |publisher=Brill |author-link=Jinyu Liu}}&lt;/ref> Historian [[Jinyu Liu]] sees them as "primarily tradesmen and/or manufacturers engaged in the production and distribution of low- or medium-quality woolen textiles and clothing, including felt and its products".&lt;ref name=Liu/>}}

===City and country===
The city was viewed as fostering civilization by being "properly designed, ordered, and adorned".{{Sfnp|Potter|2009|p=192}} Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|reorganized the city]] into neighbourhoods ''([[vicus|vici]])'' administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.&lt;ref name="rehak">{{Cite book |last=Rehak |first=Paul |title=Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius |date=2006 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref> A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the [[Campus Martius]], an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace ({{Lang|la|[[Ara Pacis Augustae]]}}) was located there, as was [[Obelisk of Montecitorio|an obelisk]] imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (''[[gnomon]]'') of a [[Solarium Augusti|horologium]].

City planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on,{{Sfnp|Stambaugh|1988|pp=23ff, 244}} and in the Eastern Empire, Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character.

[[File:Ostia-Toilets.JPG|thumb|Public toilets (''latrinae'') from [[Ostia Antica]]]]
In the city of Rome, most people lived in multistory apartment buildings (''[[Insula (building)|insulae]]'') that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (''[[thermae]]''), toilets with running water (''latrinae''), basins or elaborate fountains (''[[nymphaeum|nymphea]]'') delivering fresh water,&lt;ref name=brenda/> and large-scale entertainments such as [[chariot races]] and [[gladiator|gladiator combat]]—were aimed primarily at the common people.{{Sfnp|Jones|2003}} Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses: a townhouse (''[[domus]]'') and at least one luxury home (''[[Roman villa|villa]]'') outside the city. The ''domus'' was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (''balneum''),&lt;ref name=fagan/> but it was not a place to retreat from public life.{{Sfnp|Clarke|1991|pp=1–2}} Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses, they were not segregated enclaves.

The atrium served as a reception hall in which the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' (head of household) met with [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]] every morning.&lt;ref name=rehak/> It was a centre of family religious rites, containing a [[lararium|shrine]] and [[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|images of family ancestors]].{{Sfnp|Clarke|1991|pp=11–12}} The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces were often rented out as shops (''[[taberna]]e'').{{Sfnp|Clarke|1991|p=2}} In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the ''insulae''—townhouses typically enclosed a [[peristyle]] garden.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Stambaugh|1988|pp=144, 147}}; {{Harvp|Clarke|1991|pp=12, 17, 22ff}}&lt;/ref>

Augustus' programme of urban renewal, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as one million, was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds.

Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole ([[Cura Annonae]]) to citizens who registered for it{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=191}} (about 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome).{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=191|loc=reckoning that the surplus of wheat from the province of Egypt alone could meet and exceed the needs of the city of Rome and the provincial armies}} The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues,{{Sfnp|Morris|Scheidel|2009|p=191}} but improved living conditions among the lower classes,&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wiseman |first=T.

===Health and disease===
{{further|Disease in Imperial Rome|Antonine plague|Plague of Cyprian}}
[[Epidemics]] were common in the ancient world, and occasional [[pandemic]]s in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy. About 20 percent—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in cities, Rome being the largest. The cities were a "demographic sink": the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population. Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood. Dense urban populations and [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|poor sanitation]] contributed to disease. Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire's territories. The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius's fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.&lt;ref name="Harper">{{Cite book |last=Harper |first=Kyle |title=The Fate of Rome |date=2017 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-16683-4 |pages=10, 30–31, 67–91}}&lt;/ref>

Ordinary clothing was dark or colourful.

A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (''clavi'') woven vertically: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status.{{Sfnp|Gagarin|2010|p=231}} Other garments could be layered over the tunic.

Examples of Roman paintings can be found in [[List of ancient monuments in Rome#Palaces|palaces]], [[List of ancient monuments in Rome#Cemeteries|catacombs]] and [[Roman villa|villas]]. Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].

[[File:Roman school.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A teacher with two students, as a third arrives with his ''loculus'', a writing case{{Sfnp|Peachin|2011|p=95}}]]
Traditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories were meant to instil Roman values (''[[mos maiorum|mores maiorum]]''). Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships.{{Sfnp|Peachin|2011|pp=84–85}} Young children were attended by a [[Paedagogus (occupation)|pedagogue]], usually a Greek slave or former slave,{{Sfnp|Laes|2011|pp=113–116}} who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring.{{Sfnp|Peachin|2011|pp=90, 92}}

[[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Literature under Augustus]], along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the "Golden Age" of Latin literature, embodying [[classicism|classical ideals]].{{Sfnp|Roberts|1989|p=3}} The three most influential Classical Latin poets—[[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]—belong to this period. Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' was a national epic in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' wove together [[Greco-Roman mythology]]; his versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became a primary source of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was hugely influential on [[medieval literature]].&lt;ref>''Aetas Ovidiana''; {{cite book|first=Charles |last=McNelis|chapter=Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature|title=A Companion to Ovid|publisher=Blackwell|year= 2007|page= 397}}&lt;/ref> Latin writers were immersed in [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary traditions]], and adapted its forms and content, but Romans regarded [[satire]] as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. The early [[Principate]] produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

The mid-1st through mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the "[[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|Silver Age]]" of Latin literature. The three leading writers—[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Lucan]], and [[Petronius]]—committed suicide after incurring [[Nero]]'s displeasure. [[Epigram]]matist and social observer [[Martial]] and the epic poet [[Statius]], whose poetry collection ''[[Silvae]]'' influenced [[Renaissance literature]],&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=van Dam |first=Harm-Jan |chapter=Wandering Woods Again: From Poliziano to Grotius |date=2008 |title=The Poetry of Statius |publisher=Brill |pages=45ff}}&lt;/ref> wrote during the reign of [[Domitian]]. Other authors of the Silver Age included [[Pliny the Elder]], author of the encyclopedic ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''; his nephew, [[Pliny the Younger]]; and the historian [[Tacitus]].

The principal Latin prose author of the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan age]] is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' by [[Suetonius]] is a primary source for imperial biography. Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Josephus]], and [[Cassius Dio]]. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer [[Plutarch]], the geographer [[Strabo]], and the rhetorician and satirist [[Lucian]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, Christian authors were in active dialogue with the [[classical tradition]]. [[Tertullian]] was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the [[conversion of Constantine]], Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective.{{Sfnp|Albrecht|1997|p=1294}} In the late 4th century, [[Jerome]] produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the [[Vulgate]]. [[Augustine]] in ''[[The City of God against the Pagans]]'' builds a vision of an eternal, spiritual Rome, a new ''[[#Geography and demography|imperium sine fine]]'' that will outlast the collapsing Empire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a [[Tessellation|tessellated]] quality.{{Sfnp|Roberts|1989|p=70}} A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the ''Saturnalia'' of [[Macrobius]] and ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' of [[Martianus Capella]]. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include [[Ausonius]], [[Prudentius]], [[Claudian]], and [[Sidonius Apollinaris]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety (''[[pietas]]'') and good relations with the gods (''[[pax deorum]]''). The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', "the way of the ancestors", central to Roman identity.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Eiland |first=Murray |title=Picturing Roman Belief Systems: The iconography of coins in the Republic and Empire |date=2023 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports (Oxford) Limited |isbn=978-1-4073-6071-3 |page=22|doi=10.30861/9781407360713 }}&lt;/ref> The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same pool of men who held public office, and the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', "I give that you might give". Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.{{Sfnp|Rüpke|2007|p=4}} Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances; as many as 135 days were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]]'').&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Bunson |first=Matthew |title=A Dictionary of the Roman Empire |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=246}}&lt;/ref>

In the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion adapted to support the new regime. Augustus justified one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. [[Vota pro salute rei publicae|Public vows]] now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called "emperor worship" expanded on a grand scale the traditional [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[divus]]'') by vote of the Senate. The [[Roman imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].{{Efn|The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the "Kaaba of Najran"&lt;ref>جواد علي, المفصل في تاريخ العرب قبل الإسلام (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-'Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; "Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam"), Baghdad, 1955–1983; {{Cite book |last=Harland |first=P. |chapter=Imperial Cults within Local Cultural Life: Associations in Roman Asia |date=2003 |title=(originally published in) Ancient History Bulletin / Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte) |volume=17 |pages=91–103}}&lt;/ref>}} Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with [[Early Christianity|Christianity]], which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

The Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories, their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them,{{Efn|"This mentality," notes John T. Koch, "lay at the core of the genius of cultural assimilation which made the Roman Empire possible"; entry on "Interpretatio romana," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.}} building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.&lt;ref>{{Harvp|Rüpke|2007|p=4}}; {{Cite book |last=Isaac |first=Benjamin H. |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |date=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=449}}; {{Cite book |last=Frend |first=W.H.C. |title=Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus |date=1967 |publisher=Doubleday |page=106}}; {{Cite book |last=Huskinson |first=Janet |title=Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=261}}. See, for instance, the altar dedicated by a Roman citizen and depicting a sacrifice conducted in the Roman manner for the Germanic goddess [[Vagdavercustis]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;/ref> By the height of the Empire, numerous [[interpretatio romana|syncretic or reinterpreted gods]] were cultivated, among them cults of [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Epona]], and of solar gods such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]]. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue.&lt;ref>{{Cite journal |last=Momigliano |first=Arnaldo |date=1986 |title=The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State |journal=Classical Philology |volume=81 |issue=4 |doi=10.1086/367003 |pages=285–297 |s2cid=161203730}}&lt;/ref>

[[Mystery religions]], which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice, practiced in addition to one's [[sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of "[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Thus, sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. However, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced; its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.&lt;ref>{{Cite book |last=Fishwick |first=Duncan |title=The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire |date=1991 |publisher=Brill |isbn=90-04-07179-2 |volume=1 |pages=97–149}}&lt;/ref> The monotheistic rigour of [[Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that Judaism, unlike Christianity, was considered a ''[[religio licita]]'', "legitimate religion". The [[Jewish–Roman wars]] resulted from political as well as religious conflicts; the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD led to the sacking of the temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).
