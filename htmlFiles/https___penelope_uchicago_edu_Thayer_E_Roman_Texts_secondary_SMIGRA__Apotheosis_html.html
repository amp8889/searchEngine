APOTHEO′SIS,

(<SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">ἀποθεώσις</SPAN>), the enrolment of a mortal among the gods. The mythology of Greece contains numerous instances of the deification of mortals; but in the republican times of Greece we find few examples of such deification. The inhabitants of Amphipolis, however, offered sacrifices to Brasidas after his death

(Herod. <SPAN CLASS="small">V</SPAN>.47)</A>. In the Greek kingdoms, which arose in the East on the dismemberment of the empire of Alexander, it does not appear to have been uncommon for the successor to the throne to have offered divine honours to the former sovereign. Such an <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN> of Ptolemy, king of Egypt, is described by Theocritus in his 17th Idyl (see Casaubon's note on Suet. <I>Jul. Caes.</I> 88).

	<P CLASS="justify" ID="consecratio">
The term <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN>, among the Romans, properly signified the elevation of a deceased emperor to divine honours. This practice, which was common upon the death of almost all the emperors, appears to have arisen from the opinion, which was generally entertained among the Romans, that the souls or <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">manes</SPAN> of their ancestors became deities; and as it was common for children to worship the <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">manes</SPAN> of their fathers, so it was natural for divine honours to be publicly paid to a deceased emperor, who was regarded as the parent of his country. This <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN> of an emperor was usually called <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">consecratio</SPAN>; and the emperor who received the honour of an <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN>, was said <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">in deorum numerum referri</SPAN>, or <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">consecrari</SPAN>. In the earliest times Romulus is said to have been admitted to divine honours under the name of Quirinus (<A HREF="

Cic. <I>de Rep.</I> <SPAN CLASS="small">II</SPAN>.10</A>); but none of the other Roman kings appears to have received this honour, and in the republican times we also read of no instance of an apotheosis. Julius Caesar was deified after his death, and games were instituted to his honour by Augustus (<A HREF="

in the following passage:— "It is the custom of the Romans to deify those of their emperors who die, leaving successors; and this rite they call <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN>. On this occasion a semblance of mourning, combined with festival and religious observances, is visible throughout the city. The body of the dead they honour after human fashion, with a splendid funeral; and making a waxen image in all respects resembling him, they expose it to view in the vestibule of the palace, on a lofty ivory couch of great size, spread with cloth of gold. The figure is made pallid, like a sick man. During most of the day senators sit round the bed on the left side, clothed in black; and noble women on the right, clothed in plain white garments, like mourners, wearing no gold or necklaces. These ceremonies continue for seven days; and the physicians severally approach the couch, and looking on the sick man, say that he grows worse and worse. And when they have made believe that he is dead, the noblest of the equestrian and chosen youths of the senatorial orders take up the couch, and bear it along the

Platforms like steps are built upon each side; on one of which stands a chorus of noble youths, and on the opposite, a chorus of women of high rank, who sing hymns and songs of praise to the deceased, modulated in a solemn and mournful strain. Afterwards they bear the couch through the city to the

Campus Martius</A>, in the broadest part of which a square pile is constructed entirely of logs of timber of the largest size, in the shape of a chamber, filled with faggots, and on the outside adorned with hangings interwoven with gold and ivory images and pictures. Upon this, a similar but smaller chamber is built, with open doors and windows, and above it, a third and fourth, still diminishing to the top, so that one might compare it to the light-houses which are called <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">Phari</SPAN>. In the second story they place a bed, and collect all sorts of aromatics and incense, and every sort of fragrant fruit or herb or juice; for all cities, and nations, and persons of eminence emulate each other in contributing these last gifts in honour of the emperor. <A ID="decursus"></A>And when a vast heap of aromatics is collected, there is a procession of horsemen and of chariots<A CLASS="comment"

When all of this is done, the others set fire to it on every side, which easily catches hold of the faggots and aromatics; and from the highest and smallest story, as from a pinnacle, an eagle is let loose to mount into the sky as the fire ascends, which is believed by the Romans to carry the soul of the emperor from earth to heaven; and from that time he is worshipped with the other gods."&#8203;<A CLASS="ref" ID="ref:Cassius_Dio" HREF="

In conformity with this account, it is common to see on medals struck in honour of an <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN> an altar with fire on it, and an eagle, the bird of Jupiter, taking flight into the air. The number of medals of this description is very numerous. We can from these medals alone trace the honours of an <SPAN LANG="la" CLASS="Latin">apotheosis</SPAN>, from the time of Julius Caesar to that of Constantine the Great. On most of them the word <B><SPAN CLASS="Latin smallcaps">Consecratio</SPAN></B> occurs, and on some Greek coins the word <B><SPAN LANG="el" CLASS="Greek">ΑΦΙΕΡΩϹΙϹ</SPAN></B>.

do include adequate photos of almost all the sculpture on it. Unfortunately, the apotheosis of the emperor (or rather of his bust) is in a medallion on the ceiling of the archway. To take a good photo of it, you need to get just below it, inside the archway — which, however, is usually roped off, probably out of concerns for the security of the famous bas-relief of the spoils of Jerusalem: I imagine this is why no good photos of the apotheosis medallion can be found online.
